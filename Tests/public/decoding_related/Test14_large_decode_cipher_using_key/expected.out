many things went on at the unseen university and regrettably teaching had to be one of them the faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had perfected various devices for avoiding it but this was perfectly all right because to be fair so had the students the system had worked quite well and as happens in such cases had taken on the status of a tradition lectures clearly took place because they were down there on the timetable in black and white the fact that noone attended was an irrelevant detail it was occasionally maintained that this meant that the lectures did not in fact happen at all but noone ever attended them to find out if this was true anyway it was argued by the reader in woolly thinking which is like fuzzy logic only less so that lectures had taken place in essence so that was all right too and therefore education at the university mostly worked by the ageold method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books and hoping that something would pass from one to the other while the actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns for exactly the same reason qz
